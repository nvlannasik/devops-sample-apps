 *
 * One shared password, no user accounts. The agent's dashboard argued this from being
 * read-only; here the page is emphatically NOT read-only — it starts traffic. The reasoning
 * that survives is different: this is a fault-injection rig, every operator with the password
 * is equally entitled to drive it, and who pressed Start is a question the run's own notes
 * answer. What it does buy is the thing that matters when the page is exposed: nobody without
 * the password can point load at the cluster.
 *
 * Sessions are SIGNED, not stored. A cookie carrying its own expiry plus an HMAC over that
 * expiry needs no server-side table, survives a pod restart, and is valid on every replica —
 * a Map of session ids would lose every login on each rolling update.
